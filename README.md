    <h1> Domain Driven Architecture Application Sample </h1>
</div>

This repository was created with the intention of providing developers with a
sample domain driven architecture app for projects using React-TypeScript.

By, `sample` it is meant `basic` or `starter` application
that could be used as a template for kicking-off a project, which can become
an enhanced version of this one driven by the future project's nature and what
it is conceived best for it. However, this sample is expected to be a guide to
perform knowledge sharing with other developers who don't know about this
software architecture.
